Topic: Video Matching

Motivation:
The booming of GenAI techniques has been opening up a new horizon for content creation. With the
help of GenAI applications, text, image, video music are created faster with high quality than ever.
Our project is to tackle a specific problem in video matching. Given a short clip (a news clip registered by
a journalist for instance), we are interested in deploying an Information Retrieval Engine to find
relevant, similar videos in given video database (of a news broadcasting company). These resulting
videos could be used for creating official news videos related to the content of the inputted clip.
